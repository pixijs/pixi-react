# Fallback to Canvas

By default the PixiJS renderer uses the power of hardware acceleration (WebGL), but sometimes you need fallback support for
browsers that do not support WebGL or more modern JavaScript features.

Luckily this is possible using a `legacy` pixi package.

## Install

If using the entire pixi package, make sure to install the legacy package instead of `pixi.js`:

```bash
npm install pixi.js-legacy
```

For advanced users using `@pixi` scoped modules, make sure to properly import pixi's canvas packages:

```ts
import '@pixi/canvas-display';
import '@pixi/canvas-extract';
import '@pixi/canvas-graphics';
import '@pixi/canvas-mesh';
import '@pixi/canvas-particle-container';
import '@pixi/canvas-prepare';
import '@pixi/canvas-renderer';
import '@pixi/canvas-sprite-tiling';
import '@pixi/canvas-sprite';
import '@pixi/canvas-text';
```

Also note that these will not be installed for you. You will need to install them yourself

```bash
npm install @pixi/canvas-display
```

## Usage

Unlike in previous versions (`<=6.x`), `pixi-react` will automatically defer to the user installed `pixi` package(s) for
rendering, so you can continue to use the `@pixi/react` and `@pixi/react-animated` packages as normal. There's no need to
replace these with different legacy builds.

## Verify

Check the PixiJS welcome message in your console to make sure your application is actually running in Canvas, you should see
something like:

<img
  src="/pixi-react/img/pixi-legacy-banner.png"
  draggable={false}
  width={448}
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 448,
  }}
/>

In PixiJS v7 upwards, this welcome message is disabled by default, to enable it pass through `hello: true` in your
application options. If for some reason you specifically want to force canvas rendering in an environment that supports WebGL
then you also need to pass `forceCanvas: true`:

```jsx
<Stage options={{ hello: true, forceCanvas: true }} />
```

<img
  src="/pixi-react/img/pixi-v7-canvas-hello.png"
  draggable={false}
  width={553}
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 553,
  }}
/>
