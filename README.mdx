## News!

**ReactPixi will be a first-party React layer for PIXI and maintained by the core devs of PIXI!**

Dear ReactPixi community,

I am thrilled to announce that ReactPixi, the premier library for using Pixi.js with React, is being officially transferred to the Pixi team! This project started as a passion of mine, and it quickly grew into a beloved resource for the Pixi community thanks to all of your support.
We are excited to be working closely with the team at Pixi, to continue improving and supporting the library. We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who has supported ReactPixi over the years, and we especially want to thank Mat Groves for making this transfer possible.
We can't wait to see what the future holds for the library under the stewardship of the Pixi team. Stay tuned for updates and new developments as we work together to take ReactPixi to the next level!

Sincerely,
Patrick Brouwer

## Install

```bash
npm install @inlet/react-pixi --save
```

ReactPixi depends on pixi.js so be sure you've got that installed too!

```bash
npm install pixi.js --save
```

or use [CDN](/cdn-links):

```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/@inlet/react-pixi/dist/react-pixi.umd.js"></script>
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { Stage, Sprite } from '@inlet/react-pixi'

const App = () => (
  <Stage>
    <Sprite image="./bunny.png" x={100} y={100} />
  </Stage>
)
```

## Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const reducer = (_, { data }) => data
    const Bunny = () => {
      const [motion, update] = useReducer(reducer)
      const iter = useRef(0)
      useTick(delta => {
        const i = (iter.current += 0.05 * delta)
        update({
          type: 'update',
          data: {
            x: Math.sin(i) * 100,
            y: Math.sin(i / 1.5) * 100,
            rotation: Math.sin(i) * Math.PI,
            anchor: Math.sin(i / 2),
          },
        })
      })
      return <Sprite image="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/693612/IaUrttj.png" {...motion} />
    }
    return (
      <Stage width={300} height={300} options={{ backgroundAlpha: 0 }}>
        <Container x={150} y={150}>
          <Bunny />
        </Container>
      </Stage>
    )
  }}
</Playground>

## Components

Pass PIXI properties directly as component props, example:

```jsx
import { Sprite } from '@inlet/react-pixi'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Sprite
    texture={myTexture}
    anchor={0.5}
    position={[100, 200]}
    blendMode={PIXI.BLEND_MODES.ADD}
    roundPixels={true}
    filters={[blurFilter, matrixFilter]}
  />;
);
```
