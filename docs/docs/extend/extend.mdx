description: Learn how to extend @pixi/react with custom PixiJS components and use the extend API to keep your bundle size small.
---

One of the most important concepts to understand with v8 is `extend`. Normally `@pixi/react` would have to import all of Pixi.js to be able to provide the full library as JSX components. Instead, we use an internal catalogue of components populated by the `extend` API. This allows you to define exactly which parts of Pixi.js you want to import, keeping your bundle sizes small.

To allow `@pixi/react` to use a Pixi.js component, pass it to the `extend` API:

```jsx
import {
    Application,
    extend,
} from '@pixi/react';
import { Container } from 'pixi.js';

extend({ Container });

const MyComponent = () => (
    <pixiContainer />
);
```
